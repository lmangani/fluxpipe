# Flux Community Documentation

Flux is an open source functional data scripting language designed for querying, analyzing, and acting on data. Flux supports multiple data source types, including:

- Time series databases _(such as InfluxDB and IOx)_
- Relational SQL databases _(such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, etc)_
- Local Files or Object Storage Data _(such as CSV, TSV, JSON, etc)_

Flux unifies code for querying, processing, writing, and acting on data into a single syntax. 

The language is designed to be usable, readable, flexible, composable, testable, contributable, and shareable.
